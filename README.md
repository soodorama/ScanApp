# Scan is an app where the user can check different grocery items for their price and if they are available in the Store.
First, you have to Scan a product to add it to your scanned List as you can see below:

Once you scan a product, it will automatically be added to your scanned list, where you can add it to your shopping cart.

- The current price
and more.
